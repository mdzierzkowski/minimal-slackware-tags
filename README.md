## Minimal Slackware 

**Tagfiles and list of packages for minimal installation of Slackware Linux**

### Why?
I like the idea of a minimal system with only the software I need, something like FreeBSD's *base*. In default istallation of a **Slackware Linux** there are 8 (eight) console text editors (some of them have no release for almost 10 years), 4 console mail clients, etc.

Note that this is not a hardcore minimal set of packages. My goal is to provide a minimal **usable** installation. Having no network is not usable for most cases.
